# QuizGame - Decentralized Quiz/Trivia DApp

## Project Description

QuizGame is a decentralized quiz/trivia game built on the blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. Players can join quiz games by paying an entry fee, answer multiple-choice questions within a time limit, and earn rewards based on their performance. The game operates entirely on-chain, ensuring transparency, fairness, and immutable record-keeping of all game activities.

The smart contract manages quiz creation, player participation, answer submission, and automatic prize distribution. All game logic is executed transparently on the blockchain, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and ensuring that winners are determined fairly based on correct answers.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fully decentralized, transparent, and engaging trivia gaming ecosystem where knowledge meets blockchain technology. We aim to:

- **Democratize Knowledge Gaming**: Make trivia games accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet
- **Ensure Complete Transparency**: All game results, prize distributions, and statistics are permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Create Fair Competition**: Eliminate any possibility of cheating or manipulation through smart contract automation
- **Build Community**: Foster a global community of trivia enthusiasts who can compete and earn rewards
- **Educational Value**: Encourage learning and knowledge sharing through incentivized gameplay
